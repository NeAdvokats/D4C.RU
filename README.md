# D4C.RU v23.040.1
[По-русски](https://github.com/NeAdvokats/D4C.RU/blob/main/README_ru.md)

This project was initially conceived as a fork of the [Zapret](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret) repository, but during development it evolved into a standalone application. The first development phase is now complete - a basic structure and Electron-based interface have been created. However, it's important to note: **the current version is not yet functional.**

The name **D4C** was not chosen randomly. Much like the ability from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, the project should eventually enable a "transition" into a digital space without restrictions. The **.RU** domain indicates the target audience - users in Russia facing internet censorship.

Funny example:  
_"Do you want to stay in the censored segment of Runet or cross over into a world without blocks?"_

# Unfortunately, my JavaScript skills are completely nonexistent, so all scripts were written by others
**The program does not work.**

There may be **"technical debt"** in the code. This was made by an inexperienced developer, so if you encounter poorly written code or markup, just ignore it.

I'll fix it soon!
